# Autocompletion

A fast top-k completion based on a compressed trie (from the [B.-J. Hsu and G. Ottaviano's paper *Space Efficient Data Structures from Top-k Completion*](http://www.di.unipi.it/~ottavian/files/topk_completion_www13.pdf)).

Queries can be directed via Ã˜MQ over a sockjsproxy (https://bitbucket.org/vladev/sockjsproxy) directly from the web browser.

## Building

Building is done with [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). Only out-of-source-tree builds are supported, so do:

    mkdir MY_BUILD_DIR
    cd MY_BUILD_DIR
    cmake AUTOCOMPLETION_SOURCE_DIR
    make

CMake also supports creation of Eclipse or MSVC project files, so you don't have to use `make`.
